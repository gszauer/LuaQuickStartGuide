x = -7 -- negation operator applied to the constant 7
y = -x -- negation operator applied to the x variable
-- x: -7, y: 7

x = 7 - 3 -- Operand 1 is the constant 7, Operand 2 is the constant 3
y = x - 1 -- Operand 1 is the variable x, Operand 2 is the constant 1
z = x - y -- Operand 1 is the variable x, Operand 2 is the variable y
