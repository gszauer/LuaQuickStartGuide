# [Lua Quick Start Guide](https://luaquickstartguide.github.io/)

A small and concise guide for anyone who wants to learn Lua programming. Learn the basics of programming trough Lua regardless of your existing skill level.

## Table of contents

#### Chapter 1: Introduction to Lua

This chapter covers what Lua is and how to set up a Lua environment on any operating
system. Lua is not tied to any operating system, this chapter covers installing Lua for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

#### Chapter 2: Working with Lua

In this chapter, you
will learn the basics of Lua programming. Topics such as variables, function data types, and
loops are all going to be covered. By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar enough
with Lua as a language to put together some simple programs.

#### Chapter 3: Tables and Objects

The only data structure provided by Lua is the table. Tables are powerful
enough to implement other data structures, such as lists, queues, or stacks.
Lua is not object-oriented, however, using
tables and meta-tables, an object system can be implemented from the ground up. By the
end of this chapter, you will have implemented an object system in Lua.

#### Chapter 4: Lua Libraries

This chapter will introduce the global table,
some of Lua's built-in modules and how to create custom modules. By the end of this
chapter, you should be able to put classes into modules to make them as reusable as
possible. 

#### Chapter 5: Debugging Lua

Some of the properties that make Lua extremely powerful also make it easy to introduce
unintended bugs. Sometimes, even the simplest of bugs can take a significant amount of
effort to fix. Lua provides powerful debug libraries that help make these bugs easier to
track down and resolve. In addition to debug libraries, a number of great external tools also
exist.

#### Chapter 6: Embedding Lua

In this chapter, we're going to focus on some of the common tasks involved in embedding
Lua into any C or C++ application. While we are only focusing on the C API, Lua can be
embedded into many languages using the same API.

#### Chapter 7: Lua Bridge

The Lua C API is verbose and it can sometimes be a bit complicated to navigate.
Furthermore, if you are programming in C++, the API doesn't really fit into the OOP
idiom. There are a few binding libraries that try to bridge this gap. One of the most intuitive
and easy-to-use libraries out there is [Lua Bridge](https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge).

#### Chapter 8: Next Steps

This last chapter focuses on looking ahead at where to go next. Several resources are provided to help the reader figure out new projects to take on.
